# autoembed-iot — Constitution

<!-- This file is the PROJECT CONSTITUTION. It is loaded by every agent
     (planner / programmer / reviewer / junior reviewers) BEFORE any
     other harness file. It contains the things that, if violated,
     mean this is no longer THIS project.

     Three sections:
       Section 1 — Universal core (harness-guaranteed; can't be removed)
       Section 2 — Project identity (filled at /init; edit via /constitution-edit)
       Section 3 — Project-specific red lines (starts empty; grows via /add-constitution-clause)

     CLAUDE.md describes HOW to work (workflow, lanes, tools).
     This file describes WHAT this project stands for. -->

## Section 1 — Universal core

> **Shipped with the harness. These items are this harness's load-bearing invariants. They cannot be removed, overridden, or carved out — not by lane choice, not by direct CEO instruction, not under any circumstances. The harness exists to enforce these; remove them and the harness is no longer the harness. The CEO can ADD to them but cannot REMOVE them, even by direct instruction.**

### 1. Cross-model audit is mandatory

Every code change passes the auditor (Codex) audit at the appropriate gate. No lane exemption, no surface exemption. The auditor is independent of the implementer — that independence is the point.

**Single-engine fallback:** if `auditor_model = None`, the audit step still runs but uses a fresh-context invocation of the same model. Bias-cancellation guarantee weakens; the discipline of a second look remains.

Pure documentation, comment-only, formatting-only, and meta-file changes are exempt.

### 2. Data ownership red line

User data never leaks into logs, errors, cache, or cross-user responses. Server-side access control enforces; client trust never substitutes for enforcement. Keeping PII out of telemetry is non-negotiable.

### 3. CEO has final authority — except on Universal Core

The CEO has the final word on intent, scope, and lane. STRONG operating preferences (see `CLAUDE.md § Operating Principles`) ARE overridable by CEO with reasoning recorded in `## Decision history`.

**Exception:** Universal Core items (Section 1 of this file) are NOT overridable, even by direct CEO instruction. The CEO cannot direct a PII leak, cannot direct skipping the auditor, cannot direct shipping without smoke test, cannot direct removing this section. If a CEO instruction would violate a Universal Core item, the manager surfaces the conflict and the instruction must be reformulated; it cannot be carried out as-stated.

Authority rules:
- A CEO rejection on a STRONG item is final; no reason required.
- A CEO decision is followed; the manager (Tech Lead / Main Claude) carries it out.
- The manager may surface risks ("CEO, this carries X risk"); after the CEO decides, the discussion ends.
- A CEO decision stands even when the manager finds it illogical — surface the disagreement, then carry out the decision.
- A CEO approval scopes only what was actually requested. It does not authorize related actions, broader changes, or repeat application in future contexts.

### 4. Real-human smoke test is mandatory

AI's self-report of "done" does not count. Before any push to GitHub, the real-human user (CEO) must run the application manually against the spec's smoke-test procedures (Stage 7 of `CLAUDE.md § Workflow`).

This step cannot be skipped, cannot be AI-substituted, and cannot be bypassed via any lane — with one narrow exception: the Trivial-change lane may skip Stage 7 for pure copy/text/translation changes (spot-check still required for any logic change).

### 5. Spec and reality stay in sync

User-visible behavior changes update the corresponding `docs/features/<name>.md` in the same commit. State-coordination invariants update `docs/features/<name>-implementation.md` in the same commit.

Spec-vs-code drift makes the project lie about itself. Drift is caught by `/audit-spec`; correction is mandatory at the commit gate.

## Section 2 — Project identity

> **Filled at `/init` via 3-5 plain-language questions. Edit via `/constitution-edit`.**

**Who do we serve?**

The COMP6733 teaching team (markers/supervisor) and our own 5-person team during the project; the system's intended end users are embedded-IoT developers who want to generate working firmware from natural-language requirements.

**What do we deliberately NOT do?**

We do not build a production or commercial product, do not target arbitrary non-IoT software, do not guarantee security/compliance for public deployment, and do not chase hardware-platform breadth beyond what the demonstration and evaluation require.

**Compliance / legal floors:**

None (academic course project; no GDPR/HIPAA/PCI obligations). Standard UNSW academic-integrity rules apply.

**Performance floors that cannot be crossed:**

No hard runtime floor. The working target is AutoEmbed-comparable code-generation accuracy and task success rate on the evaluation benchmark, plus the closed-loop demo completing within the demonstration time budget.

**Other "if-violated-it's-not-this-project-anymore" statements:**

(none yet)

## Section 3 — Project-specific red lines

> **Starts empty. Grows via `/add-constitution-clause`.**

A rule should only be promoted to this section if it meets ALL THREE:

- **Project-wide scope** (not area-specific — area rules belong in rule sources)
- **Absolute** (no exceptions, no lane override)
- **Identity-changing** (violating it makes this no longer this project)

Most rules should stay in rule sources or anti-flag rules. Only promote here when the bar above is met.

*(none yet — grows via /add-constitution-clause)*
